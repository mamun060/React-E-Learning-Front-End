                                        You need an account for most activities on our platform, including purchasing and enrolling in a course. When setting up and maintaining your account, you must provide and continue to provide accurate and complete information, including a valid email address. You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account, including for any harm or damage, to us or anyone else caused by someone using your account without your permission. This means you need to be careful with your password. You may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s account without their permission. If you contact us to request access to an account, we will not grant you such access until you can provide us the login credential information for that account. In the event of the death of a user, the account of that user will be terminated.

You must notify us immediately upon knowing that someone else may be using your account without your permission by contacting our Support Team. Our team may request some information from you to confirm that you are indeed the owner of that account.

                                        There are risks inherent into using our Services, for example, if you enroll in a health and wellness course like yoga, and you injure yourself. You fully accept these risks and you agree that you will have no recourse to seek damages against even if you suffer loss or damage from using our platform and Services. In legal, more complete language, to the extent permitted by law, we (and our group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages (including loss of data, revenue, profits, or business opportunities, or personal injury or death), whether arising in contract, warranty, tort, product liability, or otherwise, and even if we’ve been advised of the possibility of damages in advance. Our liability (and the liability of each of our group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) to you or any third parties under any circumstance is limited to the greater of Ten thousand Taka (BDT 10000) or the amount you have paid us in the twelve months before the event giving rise to your claims.
